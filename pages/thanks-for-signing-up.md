Thanks for signing up for the newsletter and confirming your email address. We do this just to make sure you aren&#8217;t a bot and it also helps us ensure we are only sending information to those who really want to see it.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Your welcome email is on it&#8217;s way to you right now, so check your inbox.</strong></span>

### If you can&#8217;t see the email, check your spam or &#8220;Promotions&#8221; folder

If the email did land in the spam or promotions folder, be sure to let your email provider know that it is not spam and you would like to receive these messages.

To do this, you will usually just have to right click and mark as &#8220;Not junk&#8221; or &#8220;Not spam&#8221;.

In Gmail you can <span style="color: #ff0000;">drag the email from the Promotions folder into your Primary folder.</span>

Thanks again and I look forward to speaking to you again soon ðŸ™‚
