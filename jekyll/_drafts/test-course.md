**60%+** of people who try to learn how to program end up quitting.

Why?

Is it because "programming just isn't for everyone"?

Or is it because only those with experience in hard sciences can learn it?

**No, neither of those are true.** It's simply due to the fact that the vast majority of people who try don't have a basic understanding of the technology they're going to use. 

How exactly can you tackle responsive design if you don't now how a browser works?

How are you going to create a desktop application if you don't know what makes your computer freeze constantly (besides porn, obviously)?

How are you going to hide your confused facial expression the next time your site's server crashes because of a "node socket problem" in your full stack Javascript?

If you've ever taken your computer to a technician and said "Make it work" or "It don't work good. Me cry" then you're exactly who needs this course.

Over the next 10 years the United States is expected to add over 2 million programming jobs. Jobs that pay well over $100,000 a year. And that's just the United States (Merica').

So if you're trying to jump on the coding gravy train, put down your bronze statuette of Elon Musk standing on Mars, and start filling in the gaps in your "tech literacy". Even if you yourself do not become a "coding ninja" yourself all the future coding ninjas you work with with thank you (and tell you to stop calling them coding ninjas).

### About your instructor:

Hi, I'm Evan Kimbrell. I too struggled to learn the basics of programming. If failing to program were a sport, I'd be on the Dream Team. 

Today, I run a web and mobile development agency called Sprintkick and over the last 4 years we've built and managed over 100+ web & mobile applications. 

How does one so technologically challenged manage to pull this off? Well, first off I would disagree with "technologically challenged" (come on) and second it was actually straight forward. I just had to spend a concerted amount of time learning what I needed to know about basic computer, web, and programming technology as well as modern technology trends and advanced concepts. 

This course is an accelerated path designed to get you to "I get it" and finally start communicating correctly & effectively about technology.

### Who is the target audience?
- Anyone interested in learning how to program that is already struggling or intimidated by the process
- Anyone who wants to better communicate with development teams they work with
- Anyone who wants to hire, vet, & manage developers more effectively
- Anyone who is simply interested in getting an in depth understanding of modern web & mobile technology trends
