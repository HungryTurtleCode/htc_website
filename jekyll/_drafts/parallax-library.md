title: Hacky Parallax Code To NPM Library
image: 
excerpt: In this tutorial we will take the hacky parallax code we wrote before and turn it into a nice generalised library that can be used to implement arbitrary parallax website. Ultimately we will publish the library to NPM.

## Let's write a library

[In the previous part]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/parallax-mountains) I wrote some pretty hacky code to get a parallax effect going. In this part I will rebuild that idea into a generalised library that anyone can use to build similar effects easily. In the next part we will then publish the library on NPM for the world to actually use.

I think this is a good illustration for how typical open source projects some into being. It starts off with someone who has an idea for something they think is cool or something they think will help people out, then they create a super hacky prototype to flesh out the idea a little. Once they have something they think might work then they will start converting it into cleaner code in the format or a library.

### What were the problems

What where the problems we faced in the previous part? What made the code so hacky?

The issues we faced were

Stay hungry, and keep coding.
