## How fast can you learn React?

React is an incredibly popular choice for building frontend applications and as a result there are lots of people who want to learn it and many employers who need people who know React. But what is the fastest way to learn React?

I want to start by prefacing that you cannot learn React in a few hours if you are starting from zero. If you are a seasoned frontend developer and you know some other frameworks really well then you will be able to pick up react very quickly because you understand the problems it is solving. If you are starting from scratch with frontend development though, it will take some time. But let's talk about how you can get the most out of your time and get up to speed as quickly as possible.

Another thing to note is that there is no one linear path to learn React. Learning is never linear. It's an exploration. So when you hear people saying "You need to learn the fundamentals of Javascript before you touch react" or any other "You need to learn x before y" don't listen to them. Think of learning as a graph where each node is a topic and the whole graph represents your knowledge. The goal is to illuminate as many nodes as possible and try to connect each of them to as many other related ideas as possible. The order you do that does not matter so much.


Yes, learning the fundamentals of React may mean that some things you see in React are not confusing to you because you recognise what it is - but you probably took some time to understand that idea in Javascript first, which saved you time when you saw it in React. However, if you didn't know that idea before you see it in react you can still understand it after a little confusion but then when you finally discover that idea when looking into the fundamentals of Javascript you will have a real world example of how to use that idea and you save time the second time round!

**Meaning the order doesn't matter - the second idea you learn always builds on the first regardless of order.**

But lets get onto some specifics of how to go about learning React.

## Read the Docs
Honestly. I have spent so much of my adult life reading technical documentation and I can honestly say that React has some of the best documentation around. It is written in plain language and it does not make any assumptions about your level of knowledge. They are clearly structured and organised very well. They even have a tutorial course that walks you through building your first React app. I still regularly consult the React docs when I can't quite remember how a particular feature works.

It's also a great habit to get into to go to the docs when you want to learn about something. Granted, sometimes the docs confuse you more than they help but that doesn't detract from the value of going to docs in general. It will also help you write you own documentation in the future when you write the most amazing libraries with your new found React knowledge.

### Simplify - Don't focus on tools
Too often tutorials on React are 40% react tutorial and 60% build tooling and random npm package tutorial. If you really want to learn React fast you need to be sure that what you are learning is all actually React and not tooling or libraries in the React ecosystem.

Those tools are important and you will need to learn about them eventually. But they shouldn't be the first thing you learn.

### Chunky knowledge
This is related to the concept of [chunking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)) in psychology which comes from research into how humans learn. For humans to learn we need to create "chunks" of information that we can store in the brain. We start out learning the simplest things then join some of those ideas into chunks of larger information that can be accessed as one idea. Then clusters of chunks are joined into larger chunks. This is how humans learn. So your studies should try to encourage this.

Think of this analogy: A beginner chess player and a grandmaster looking at the same chess board. The grandmaster has countless hours of practice and study behind them so their knowledge chunks are very large - they can look at the board as a whole unit and see the tactical and strategic ideas as a single cohesive unit because they know how certain positions look and how certain combinations of pieces work together.

On the other hand the beginner has to look at the individual pieces and individual moves they can make. Gradually checking each move in turn to try decide which move to make.

If you are that beginner trying to improve you will not learn much trying to think in the same way as the grandmaster because you do not have the requisite chunks of information in your brain. You need to approach the game piece by piece in an attempt to generate and cultivate those chunks. Then you can start moving up the levels of thinking.

The same is true in React. You cannot start by seeing a full application pipeline with a build system and test suites and continuous integration and all things that come along with a production application. You need to start at the lowest level and start chunking up from there.

Tools like Create React App help with this but I still think total beginners can go a step further and just start without a build tool at all. React can be added to a regular HTML page with just a script tag. Get used to that then add babel to transpile the JSX. You will more deeply understand the JSX because you started from a smaller chunk - raw react elements.

Tooling can be picked up quickly later once you have sufficient knowledge chunks in your head for react. So don't focus on learning tools at the start - focus on the specifics of react itself.

This also makes your job way easier because React is not a big library. There isn't much to learn in terms of specific syntax. But you could spend a lifetime learning the tooling around react and still not cover most of it. So start simple and learn tools as you need them.

## Forget Best Practices
Best practices are there to help teams build maintainable and scalable applications. They are not there to help you learn. Focusing on or spending time on learning best practices at the beginning is just adding to the cognitive load. That is brain power that could be better used to learn react better instead. Like tooling, the best practices can be learned later.

It is also much better to approach learning with a beginners mind and actively seek out making mistakes. In doing so you will discover best practices on your own because you will realise the way you did something made something else harder. You will now more deeply understand why that is a best practice instead of blindly following a blog post on Medium. 

The kind of rigidity best practices imply goes directly counter to learning things well. Learning is about exploration, not rigid rules. 

Once you have learned the basics of react and made a ton of mistakes you will be ready to understand why some best practices exist - assuming you haven't derived them all on your own.

## Build things
Speaking about making mistakes. You should build as much as possible. There is literally no substitute for this. Build anything and everything. It really doesn't matter. Pick anything. Copy things. Quantity is the key here - quality will come later.

**You are building good skills right now, not good applications**

Don't get bogged down thinking about what to build. It doesn't have to even be a full app. Just recreate components that are cool. See a tool tip on a website you like? Recreate it in React. What about that information card you saw yesterday? Try it! Want to just tinker and make stuff up - do it. Recreate twitter? Go for it. As long as you are building you cannot do anything wrong.

## Experiment
The final point is again related to the idea of keeping a beginners mind and making mistakes. Experiment and explore. Go crazy.

Ask yourself crazy questions:

- What if you build the whole app as a single component?
- What if we try to build it with as many tiny components as possible and compose everything.
- Try whatever ridiculous idea you have

You need to find where the extremes are to become comfortable in the middle. In doing so you will naturally discover best practices and it will deepen your understanding of why certain things are done in certain ways. You will just become a better developer for it.

Of course, when you are writing professional applications you won't be doing these crazy things - but if you have done those crazy things when you are learning you will better understand the whys and hows of writing good, professional grade code.

So to round up, here are my recommendations for learning React as quickly as possible:

- Read the docs
- Simplify. Focus on chunking small pieces of information. Forget about tooling
- Forget about best practices
- Build things
- Experiment

Stay hungry, and keep coding.
