## Who Am I? And What Is Hungry Turtle Code?

I will start with myself. My name is Adrian Henry and I founded Hungry Turtle Code. I am a 23 year old currently living in Ireland.

Code has played a part of my life since my early teens, but I was always mainly a hardware kind of guy. I loved tinkering with electronics and building cool projects. Of course code was usually involved in some capacity.

I then went to University and did a degree in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at Loughborough University in Leicestershire, England.

I even worked for a year as an Electronic Engineer at a (very) large multinational.

### I Needed MOAR Code!

During my time at university, I started getting more and more focused on code. I took modules in C, C++, ARM assembly as well as a lot of Matlab (engineers looooooove Matlab, often too much. But that&#8217;s a whole different conversation).

Things really started to turn for me when I got involved in a module dedicated to computer networking, specifically TCP/IP. During this time I started writing network level Python.

It was at this point that I knew software was where I should be, despite still having a deep and passionate love for hardware.

During this time, I was also pursuing other programming languages in my spare time. I learnt JavaScript and PHP and started doing some freelance web development to earn some extra money.

I started off doing very basic projects just to gain experience. PSD to HTML conversions and that sort of thing &#8211; adding some jQuery and thinking I was the greatest.

After my year of full time employment as an Electronic Engineer I had a few realisations.

  1. I didn&#8217;t like having a boss.
  2. My real skill set lay in code.

It was at that point that I started getting more serious with the freelance web work I was doing. I was filling my day with doing projects for clients and reading and learning about all the latest technologies and news.

In my spare time I would still tinker with other programming projects.

## The (Hungry Turtle) Code Life.

Things were going great. I was learning a ton. This is where another part of my life intersects with this.

I have always enjoyed teaching people things, ever since I was very young. I didn&#8217;t always get it right, but I enjoyed the process. I became the &#8220;go to&#8221; guy when people wanted things explaining to them.

As I grew older, my ability to explain (apparently) improved. When people started hearing more and more about my professional life with code they started asking questions.

It was then a natural extension to just create a site to start teaching some of the things I knew. The more I thought about it, the more I really liked the idea.

I get to learn things and teach those things to others. It was a win win all round. I love it.

The added bonus is that I may be able to make a small amount of money to maintain the longevity of the site through some adverts and occasional premium courses. 95%+ of the content I create will be free though!

### But where does Hungry Turtle come from?

Honestly, I have no idea. It just came to me one day when I was thinking of names. All I knew is I didn&#8217;t want to fall into the trap of looking &#8220;hipster&#8221; or &#8220;corporate&#8221;.

I certainly didn&#8217;t want a name like &#8220;Codrr&#8221; or something like that. I wanted something that was catchy and stuck out without fitting into some stereotype.

Hungry is also a nice word to use in an educational context as it implies desire and that is what sums up my aims for myself and everyone who uses this site.

**Plus, Turtles are AMAZING!**

Feel free to follow me on social media (Links in the sidebar and footer), I try to be as active as possible.

I like to engage in conversation, **so don&#8217;t be shy.**

Adrian
