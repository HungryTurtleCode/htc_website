**Personally Identifiable data**
* Email - this is used as a way to uniquely identify your user account on our system (a username).
  * Email is also used to verify you are a real user (via a confirmation email sent to you upon registering an account)
  * Email is also used to recover your account in cases where you have lost your password.
  * Occasional emails will be sent to you regarding news and product offerings from Hungry Turtle Code. You can opt out of this at any time by clicking "unsubscribe" at the bottom of any of the emails sent.
  * You can change the email registered with us at any point through your user dashboard.
* Name
  * This is collected so any comments you leave on pages on the Site are shown as being from you. 
  * You can change the name you use on the Site at any point through your user dashboard. Changing it will change all occurrences of your name on the site, even those created in the past.
* Articles and tutorials you have viewed.
  * Any time you view a new article or tutorial on the site, it is recorded against your user account.
  * This is done to allow for improved content into the future by knowing what users are interested in.

**How long is the data kept**

All of the information mentioned above is kept indefinitely, unless otherwise requested by the user in question.

**Is the information shared**

* Your email address is shared with an email service provider to who will not send you any emails without the consent of Hungry Turtle Code. 
  * A third party email provider is used to avoid the overhead of maintaining email servers and to ensure quality of email delivery. Spam filters recognise when an email is coming from a reputable email provider and are more likely to let the emails through than they would be if a custom email server was used.
* Google analytics, facebook tracking pixels and google adsense collect their own data but nothing explicitly given to Hungry Turtle Code is passed on to them.
  * Except in the case where a Visitor registers with the Site using OAuth from a social account (facebook, google etc). In that case the social site used will be aware of your usage of the Site, but no extra information is provided.
* No other information is shared with any other third party.

**What are your rights**

* You can view all the data we have on you by emailing adrian@hungryturtlecode.com
* If you want your information permanently deleted from the system, email adrian@hungryturtlecode.com
